    <idlerpm> 800.0 </idlerpm>
			<!-- this value affects the throttle fall off and the engine stops running

			<!-- this value is used to calculate air-box resistance and BSFC.

			<!-- this number is the pressure drop across the intake system. Increasing it reduces available manifold pressure.

    <maxmp unit="INHG"> 28.8 </maxmp>
			<!-- this value is the nominal maximum manifold pressure at sea-level without boost.
			Along with maxrpm it determines the resistance of the aircraft's intake system. 
			See air-intake-impedance-factor 

			It is used for determining <BSFC> and <air-intake-impedance-factor> if a values are not supplied
			for those items. In a supercharged engine is always the pressure at sea level under standard 
			conditions (29.9). -->

			<!-- Indicated Specific Fuel Consumption.

    <cylinder-head-mass unit="LBS"> 9.25 </cylinder-head-mass>
			<!-- the nominal mass of a cylinder head. A larger value slows changes in engine temperature.

			<!-- this number models how efficient the aircraft cooling system is. Raising the value makes
			the engine run cooler. This value is exposed on the property tree so it may be
			altered at runtime to simulate cowl flaps, for example. -->
